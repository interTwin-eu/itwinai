See the latest version of our [docs](https://intertwin-eu.github.io/T6.5-AI-and-ML/)
for a quick overview of this platform for advanced AI/ML workflows in digital twin applications.

If you want to integrate a new use case, you can follow this
[step-by-step guide](https://intertwin-eu.github.io/T6.5-AI-and-ML/docs/How-to-use-this-software.html).

## Installation

Requirements:

- Linux, macOS environment. Windows was never tested.
- Micromamba: [Installation guide](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#micromamba).

Install the orchestrator virtual environment.

```bash
# Create local env
make

# Activate env
conda activate ./.venv
```

To run tests on workflows use:

```bash
# Activate env
conda activate ./.venv

pytest tests/
```

### Documentation folder

Documentation for this repository is maintained under `./docs` location.
If you are using code from a previous release, you can build the docs webpage
locally using [these instructions](docs/README#building-and-previewing-your-site-locally).

## Development env setup

Requirements:

- Linux, macOS environment. Windows was never tested.
- Micromamba: [Installation guide](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#micromamba).
- VS Code, for development.

Installation:

```bash
make dev-env

# Activate env
conda activate ./.venv-dev
```

To run tests on itwinai package:

```bash
# Activate env
conda activate ./.venv-dev

pytest tests/ai/
```

## AI environment setup

Requirements:

- Linux, macOS environment. Windows was never tested.
- Micromamba: [Installation guide](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#micromamba).

**NOTE**: this environment gets automatically setup when a workflow is executed!

However, you can also set it up explicitly with:

```bash
make ai-env

# Activate env
conda activate ./ai/.venv-pytorch
```

### Updating the environment files

The files under `ai/env-files/` are of two categories:

- Simple environment definition, such as `pytorch-env.yml`
and `pytorch-env-gpu.yml`
- Lockfiles, such as `pytorch-lock.yml` and `pytorch-gpu-lock.yml`,
generated by [`conda-lock`](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/cli/gen/).

**When you install the ai environment, install it from the lock file!**

When the "simple" environment file (e.g., `pytorch-env.yml`) changes,
lock it with [`conda-lock`](https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/cli/gen/):

```bash
conda activate ./.venv

make lock-ai
```
