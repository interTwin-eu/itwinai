`itwinai` is a Python toolkit designed to help scientists and researchers streamline AI and machine learning
workflows, specifically for digital twin applications. It provides easy-to-use tools for distributed training,
hyper-parameter optimization on HPC systems, and integrated ML logging, reducing engineering overhead and accelerating
research. Developed primarily by CERN, in collaboration with Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich (FZJ), `itwinai` supports modular
and reusable ML workflows, with the flexibility to be extended through third-party plugins, empowering AI-driven scientific
research in digital twins.
