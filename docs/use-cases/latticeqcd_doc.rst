Normalizing flow for generating lattice field configurations (Lattice QCD, ETHZ/CSIC)
=====================================================================================

The code is adapted from `this notebook <https://github.com/jkomijani/normflow_>` from the Lattice QCD use-case.

More information on the use-case is available in the published deliverables,
`D4.2 <https://zenodo.org/records/10417138>`_,
`D7.2 <https://zenodo.org/records/10417161>`_ and `D7.4 <https://zenodo.org/records/10224277>`_.

In order to setup the environment, please first look at the `itwinai installation instructions
<https://itwinai.readthedocs.io/latest/installation/developer_installation.html>`. Once `itwinai` is installed,
navigate to the use-case directory under `use-cases/lattice-qcd` and simply run `pip install .`.

Further details on the use-case can be found in the use-case's README:
