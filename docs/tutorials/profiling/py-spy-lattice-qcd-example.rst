Profiling Lattice QCD with the ``py-spy`` Profilerâ€”an Example
=============================================================

The following is an example of how we used the ``py-spy`` profiler to find a bottleneck in the
Lattice QCD use case. 

Introduction
------------

Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the study of the strong interaction between quarks
mediated by gluons. This is a very technical field, but the details of the use case are not
very important for the sake of this tutorial. You can read more about the use case on the
`GitHub page for normflow <https://github.com/jkomijani/normflow_/>`_.
