Integrated Use Cases
====================

Here you can find a collection of use cases including various projects.

3DGAN CERN use case
-------------------

The first ``interTwin`` use case integrated with ``itwinai`` framework is the DT for fast particle detector simulation. 
3D Generative Adversarial Network (3DGAN) for generation of images of calorimeter depositions. 
This project is based on the prototype `3DGAN <https://github.com/svalleco/3Dgan/tree/Anglegan/keras>`_ model developed at CERN and is implemented on PyTorch Lightning framework.

MNIST use case
--------------

MNIST image classification is used to provide an example on 
how to define an end-to-end digital twin workflow with the ``itwinai`` software.
