Submitting jobs to SLURM on HPC
====================================

Here you can find a minimal set of resources to use SLURM job scheduler on an HPC cluster.

What is SLURM? See this quickstart: https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html

SLURM cheatsheets:

- https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf
- https://www.carc.usc.edu/user-information/user-guides/hpc-basics/slurm-cheatsheet

Commands
--------

- ``sinfo``: get cluster status (e.g., number of free nodes at the moment).
- ``squeue -u USERNAME``: visualize the queue of jobs of ``USERNAME`` user.
- ``sbatch JOBSCRIPT``: submit a `job script`_ to the SLURM queue.
- ``scontrol show job JOBID``: get detailed info of job with ``JOBID`` id.
- ``scancel JOBID``: cancel job with ``JOBID`` id.
- ``scancel -u USERNAME``: cancel all jobs of ``USERNAME`` user.
- ``srun``: is used to execute a command in a SLURM job script. Example: ``srun python train.py``.
- ``sacct -j JOBID``: Get job stats after completion/when running.

SLURM commands on JSC: https://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/hps/juwels/batchsystem.html#slurm-commands

Job scripts for batch jobs
--------------------------

SLURM job scripts are regular shell files enriched with some ``#SBATCH`` directives at the top.

To know more, see this: https://www.osc.edu/book/export/html/2861

Check job status
----------------

Once a job is submitted to the SLURM queue, it goes through a number of states before finishing.
You can check in which state is a job of interest using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   scontrol show job JOBID

To interpret the state code, use this guide: https://confluence.cscs.ch/display/KB/Meaning+of+Slurm+job+state+codes 

Interactive shell on a compute node
-----------------------------------

Allocate a compute node with 4 GPUs on JSC supercomputer:

.. code-block:: bash

   salloc --account=intertwin --partition=batch --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=4 --gpus-per-node=4 --time=01:00:00

Once resources are available, the command will return a ``JOBID``. Use it to jump into the compute node with the 4 GPUs in this way:

.. code-block:: bash

   run --jobid JOBID --overlap --pty /bin/bash

   # Check that you are in the compute node and you have 4 GPUs
   nvidia-smi

Eventually, remember to load the correct environment modules before activating the python virtual environment.

Environment variables
---------------------

Before running a job, SLURM will set some environment variables in the job environment.

See here a table of them: https://www.glue.umd.edu/hpcc/help/slurmenv.html

Job arrays
----------

Job arrays allow to conveniently submit a collection of similar and independent jobs.
