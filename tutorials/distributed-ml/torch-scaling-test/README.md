# Scaling tests for PyTorch of ResNet152 on Imagenet

**Author(s)**: Matteo Bunino (CERN), Jarl Sondre SÃ¦ther (CERN)

## Introduction

This tutorial will show you an example of running a scalability test using the metrics
provided by the `itwinai` library. It will also show how `itwinai`'s distributed
strategies simplify the code for distributed training, and that the computational
overhead of these strategies is negligible, or even non-existent.

The tutorial uses the following three strategies for distributed machine learning:

- PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)
- Horovod
- Microsoft DeepSpeed

Each strategy is implemented both as a stand-alone implementation and as a part of the
`itwinai_trainer.py` script, the latter of which using the `itwinai` distributed
strategies. One particularly noticeable difference is how we are able to use a single
file for all the different strategies when using `itwinai`.

### Dataset

This tutorial uses the ImageNet dataset to test the scalability of the different
strategies. The ImageNet dataset is very large and computationally demanding, taking a
long time to complete. Therefore, if you wish to only perform a quick test, you can
set the `subset_size` parameter in the `config/base.yaml` configuration file to only
train on a subset of the data. Through trial and error, we found that setting the
subset size to around 5000 works well for quick experimentation.

### Scalability Metrics

The `itwinai` library offers multiple scalability metrics, but some of these require
the itwinai trainer, which is not used in this tutorial, and are therefore unavailable.
We do have functionality of logging the relative and absolute time, however, and it is
these metrics that are included.

### Configuration and argument parsing

Configuration files are stored in the `config/` folder:

- `base.yaml` provides the configuration common to all training experiments.
- `ddp.yaml` provides the configuration specific to DDP.
- `horovod.yaml` provides the configuration specific to Horovod.
- `deepspeed.yaml` provides the configuration specific to DeepSpeed.

Thanks to the `itwinai.parser.ArgumentParser`, the arguments can be parsed both from
the CLI itself as well as from an arbitrary number of configuration files.
Additionally, fields in the configuration files can be overridden in the CLI as needed.
Example:

```bash
# Rather than requiring a LONG list of inline configuration params...
python ddp_trainer.py --data-dir some/dir --log-int 10 --verbose --nworker 4 ...

# ...itwinai's ArgumentParser allows using a set of configuration files, with inline
# override if needed
python ddp_trainer.py -c config/base.yaml -c config/ddp.yaml --log-int 42
```

## Run a single training

Training runs should be submitted using SLURM. To do this, you can use the provided
`slurm.py` file, which leverages the `itwinai.slurm.SlurmScriptBuilder` for automatic
SLURM script generation. The builder uses the `slurm_config.yaml` file for parameters,
meaning that you don't have to add all your SLURM parameters inline. If you have
specified the parameters to your liking (e.g. how many GPUs to use, how long the
training should last etc.), you can run the SLURM script with the following command:

```bash
python slurm.py -c slurm_config.yaml
```

Running this command will submit the job and store the script to file. If you don't
want the job to be submitted immediately, you could add `--no-submit-job`, allowing you
to inspect the saved file before running it. If you don't want to store the script for
later use, then you can add `--no-retain-file`. If you add both of these, the builder
will simply print the resulting script without running or saving it, allowing you to
quickly tinker with it before running it. An example of the full command with both
of these options looks like this:

```bash
python slurm.py -c slurm_config.yaml --no-retain-file --no-submit-job
```

If you want to override any of the fields from the configuration file, you can add the
argument inline after, like this:

```bash
python slurm.py -c slurm_config.yaml --no-retain-file --no-submit-job --job-name my_job
```

Here, we overrode the `job-name` field with the value `my_job`.

## Run all the distributed strategies

To run all the distributed strategies, e.g. `DDP`, `Horovod` and `DeepSpeed`, you can
use the `mode` argument with the `runall` option like so:

```bash
python slurm.py --mode runall
```

It is also possible to add a configuration file, but keep in mind that the `runall`
mode will override certain fields like the distributed strategy etc. Similar to before,
you can also print the scripts before choosing to run them. An example of running all
the distributed strategies with a configuration file where you print the scripts first
can be seen here:

```bash
python slurm.py -c slurm_config.yaml --no-retain-file --no-submit-job --mode runall
```

## Run scaling test

If you wish to run a scaling test, you can set the `mode` to `scaling-test`. This will
launch all the distributed strategies with different number of nodes. An example of
this can be seen here:

```bash
python slurm.py -c slurm_config.yaml --no-retain-file --no-submit-job --mode scaling-test
```

## Analyze results

Once all jobs have completed, you can generate a scalability report using the following
command:

```bash
itwinai generate-scalability-plot 
    
```

To see the full list of possible arguments, type:

```bash
itwinai generate-scalability-plot --help
```
